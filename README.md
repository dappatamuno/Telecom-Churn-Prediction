# Telecom-Churn-Prediction
ðŸ“Œ Project Title: Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

Predicting customer churn using machine learning and deep learning techniques.

ðŸ“Œ Project Description

Objective: Predict whether a telecom customer will churn (leave the service) based on features like contract type, tenure, and monthly charges.

Models Used: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, AdaBoost, XG Boost, TensorFlow DNN.

Best Model: XG Boost (82.94% accuracy) outperformed others.

## Dataset Setup
1. Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn).
2. Place `WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv` in the `data/` folder.

ðŸ“Œ Key Insights from EDA

High Churn Risk Factors:

Month-to-month contracts.

High monthly charges.

Lack of online security/tech support.

Low Churn Factors:

Long-term contracts (2-year).

Higher tenure (long-term customers).
